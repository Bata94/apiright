# APIRight

A Go framework that transforms SQLC structs into ready-to-use CRUD APIs.

## Overview

APIRight is designed to bridge the gap between your database models (generated by SQLC) and REST APIs. It provides:

- **Automatic CRUD endpoints** for your SQLC-generated structs
- **Transition layer** between database models and API models
- **Configurable routing** with sensible defaults
- **Built-in middleware** for common API functionality
- **Type-safe operations** leveraging Go's type system

## Features

- 🚀 **Zero-config CRUD**: Expose CRUD endpoints with minimal setup
- 🔄 **Model transformation**: Clean separation between DB and API models
- 🛡️ **Type safety**: Leverages SQLC's type-safe code generation
- 🎯 **Flexible routing**: Customizable URL patterns and HTTP methods
- 📝 **Auto-documentation**: Generate API documentation from your models
- 🔧 **Middleware support**: Built-in and custom middleware integration

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/bata94/apiright"
    "github.com/bata94/apiright/crud"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize APIRight with your database
    app := apiright.New()
    
    // Register your SQLC models for CRUD operations
    crud.Register[User](app, crud.Config{
        TableName: "users",
        IDField:   "id",
    })
    
    // Start the server
    app.Listen(":8080")
}
```

## Development

This project uses Nix for development environment management.

```bash
# Enter the development shell
nix develop

# Run the example
go run examples/basic/main.go
